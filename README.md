# Locomotive-Wheel-Lathe-Model
.STL files for a non-working 1:48 scale model representing a belt driven locomotive wheel lathe used in the 1920â€™s.
Because of the complexity of the model I've broken it down into separate groups for printing.
This was originally printed on a resin type Anycubic Photon 3D printer.
I would recommend starting with the Faceplates, then the Faceplate Housings, Base, Workstands and then the gears and smaller parts.
I used brass rod for the gear shafts and posts.  Refer to the Locomotive Wheel Lathe Complete file for appropriate sizes.
